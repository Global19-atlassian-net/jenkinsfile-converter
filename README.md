# Jenkinsfile Convertor
A tool to help Jenkins users get a head start on building on CircleCI by converting a `Jenkinsfile` to CircleCI `config.yml`. 

While this tool should output a valid `config.yml`, this tool is not yet feature complete. `config.yml` should be reviewed and edited as necessary before running the initial CircleCI build.

For more about CircleCI, see https://circleci.com

## Overview
`node index.js path/to/Jenkinsfile` will create a `config.yml` file in the root directory. 

## Supported Syntax
Only declarative `Jenkinsfile`s are currently supported.
